- Extend stage shape to have simple maze like stages.

BUG
========
Zoom-out works only after zoom in has been triggered.
Coins & dash/break indicators overlaps stage progress (lives, seed, starts, score, time)

PENDING

DONE
========
BUG: Movable parts are not colliding anymore with sphere or opponents.
- Create a main menu with 3 game modes:
  - single player: (with fixed stages, difficulty progression)
  - random: you can choose difficulty among simple, medium, hard, hell. Difficulty level drives stage shape complexity and size, number of movable parts, number of enemies, number of collectibles
  - Custom: You can select any parameters for generation. Seed is random 
- Make the stages not only squared, but with some variations
- Make the project modularized, easy to maintain, POO and production-grade
- Add eased zoom-in with R2 and eased zoom-out with L2. When released, camera gets back to default. Add equivalents for keyboard (right shift, left shift)
- Add dash with R1 (with cooldown) and break with L1 for hard turn. Add equivalents for keyboard (right ctrl, left ctrl)
- Display when controller gets disconnected (like it is when connected). move this message a bit upper than current position, it is overlapping with game hints
- Make left stick navigating menu (as DPAD). Fix DPAD direction in-game (left is not going left, up not up, ...). Make navigation in menu possible with keyboard arrows and enter/escape keys
- for text hints, when using XBOX controller, show xbox icons, when swapping to keyboard, show keyboard, ...etc.
- Add navigation for each elements of the game for the current device (xbox, keyboard, phone touch input, ...)
- Add controller controls (xbox, directinput, phone axis)
- Add stage powerup, scores (based on time to complete the stage), rewards (in-game currency) and persistent power-ups that we can buy/upgrade out of the stage (in a menu item) but impacts the game run (rogue lite) and persist. Rewards needs to be selected, with maximum to possible slots, where we can swap the enabled power-ups._
- Pause the game while in shop_
